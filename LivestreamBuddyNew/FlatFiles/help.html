    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <br />
    <div>
        <h3>Why do the viewer counts in the stream feed and the viewer list not match?</h3>
        <p>The viewer list count comes from IRC and only shows logged in viewers.  The stream feed count comes from Twitch and shows both logged in and anonymous viewers.</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        <h3>Why does it sometimes take a few moments before my viewer list populates?</h3>
        <p>The chat and viewer list utilize Twitch's IRC servers.  Sometimes, when they are under high load, they will take a few moments to return data.</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        <h3>What should I do if I find a bug or have a feature request?</h3>
        <p>Go <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/livestreambuddy/" target="_blank">here</a> and use the "Tracking" feature, there should be a button or tab or something... you probably need to be logged into SourceForge.</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        <h3>I entered a bug or feature request using SourceForge's "Tracking" feature like you told me to.  Why isn't it done yet?</h3>
        <p>I'm lazy.  You want it done faster?  There's a donate button.  Money makes me go faster.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Why is LivestreamBuddy all of a sudden using so much memory and CPU?</h3>
        <p>Supporting emoticons in chat increases memory consumption by a large amount.  You can disable it in the options.</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        <h3>I see some chat text that should be emoticons.  How do I make that text show up as emoticons?</h3>
        <p>LivestreamBuddy stores a list of emoticons from Twitch.  Twitch may update that list on their servers periodically.  You can force LivestreamBuddy to obtain a new list from Twitch by running with the -refreshemoticons flag.</p>
